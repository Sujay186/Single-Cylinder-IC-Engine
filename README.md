# Single Cylinder IC Engine - SolidWorks Design & Simulation

## Project Overview
This project features a fully detailed 3D model of a single-cylinder internal combustion (IC) engine designed in SolidWorks, complete with motion 
analysis, manufacturing-ready engineering drawings, and a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM). The engine assembly includes all critical components 
such as the crankshaft, piston, connecting rod, camshaft, valves, and timing gears, modeled with precise mechanical constraints to ensure realistic motion simulation.

### Key Features & Components

1. 3D Parametric Modeling
- Fully constrained assembly with accurate mates (concentric, coincident, gear relations)

- Individual part files for each component, allowing customization (e.g., bore size, stroke length)
  
2. Motion Analysis & Simulation
- Piston movement: Simulates reciprocating motion with crank-slider mechanism

- Valve actuation: Camshaft-driven valve timing with rocker arm dynamics

- Gear interaction: Meshing between bigger gear (crankshaft) and smaller gear (camshaft)

- Full engine cycle: Demonstrates intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes

3. Detailed Engineering Drawing
- Dimensions: All critical measurements in millimeters (mm)

- Exploded view & section cuts for assembly clarity

4. Bill of Materials (BOM)
-The engine consists of 14 key components, including:

 Crankshaft (1x) – Transfers piston motion into rotational force
 Piston & Piston Pin (1x each) – Converts combustion energy into motion
 Connecting Rod & Lock (1x each) – Links piston to crankshaft
 Valves & Retainers (2x each) – Controls air/fuel intake and exhaust
 Camshaft & Rocker Arms (1x & 2x) – Manages valve timing
 Timing Gears (Bigger & Smaller) (1x each) – Synchronizes crankshaft & camshaft
